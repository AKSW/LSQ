{"name":"LSQ","tagline":"LSQ: The Linked SPARQL Queries Dataset","body":"### LSQ.\r\nLSQ: A Linked Dataset describing SPARQL queries extracted from the logs of a variety of prominent public SPARQL endpoints. We argue that this dataset has a variety of uses for the SPARQL research community, be it, for example, to generate benchmarks on-the-fly by selecting real-world queries with specific characteristics that we describe, or to conduct analysis of what SPARQL (1.1) query features are most often used to interrogate endpoints, or to characterise the behaviour of the different types of agents that are using these endpoints, or to find out what queries agents are asking about a given resource, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
