ANN: Linked SPARQL Queries (LSQ) Version 2.0 Software Pre-Release

We are happy to announce a completely revamped software framework for RDFizing and benchmarking SPARQL queries from
various Web servers log formats.

* Automatic log format probing
* Easy-to-use command line interface
* Java API to read/write the LSQ RDF model
* Greatly improved LSQ data model (not compatible with the prior version)
* Greatly simplified log RDFization
* Greatly improved benchmarking process; added new configuration options to control scalability aspects
* Greatly improved documentation (https://github.com/AKSW/LSQ/wiki/)
* Improved hashing to reduce chance of collisions (w.r.t. to prior version)

Comments, suggestions and (constructive) criticism is always welcome :)

Best regards,

Mohammed Saleem and Claus Stadler
